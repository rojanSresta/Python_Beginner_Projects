# Pig Game

<ul> 
<li>
  
This is a two player game where we are going to increase our score until the player wants to stop.
</li>
<li>
  
The game basically works on increasing score by the number we get by rolling our dice.
</li>
<li>
  
We are going to generate random number between 1 and 6 and then let the user play.
</li>
<li>
  
First, when the dice is roll, we will get a certain number then if the number is not one then the player score increases but if the generated number is 1 then the score will be reset and next player is given turn.

</li>
<li>
  
Example: 
<br>
1st roll = 5
<br>
2nd roll = 4
<br>
if stopped by player then score = 5+4 = 9
<br>
if player got 1 then score will be set to zero and next player turn
<br>
</li>
<li>
  
Player can decide to roll the dice again or not by entering 'y' or 'n'.
</li>

<li>
  
The player who first gets the score of 50 or more than 50 that player is the winner but only if the player wants to stop.
